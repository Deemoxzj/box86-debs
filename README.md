This repository is no longer being updated since I do not have the resources to do so.

I highly recommend checking out Itai's repo for weekly box86 builds: [https://github.com/Itai-Nelken/weekly-box86-debs](https://github.com/Itai-Nelken/weekly-box86-debs), or if you're looking for box64 debs, click [here](https://github.com/ryanfortner/box64-debs).
